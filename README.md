# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

I am tasked with determining the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will aid management in preparing for a large exodus of employees who have reached retirement age. 

##Results:

*As the bar graph shows below, the majority of those of retiring age are in the positions of Senior Engineer or Senior Staff.    The pie chart will show that together, these positions make up roughly 64% of the current staff.

*The total amount of employees retiring is 90,398.

*There are 1,549 current employees who are eligible to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.  A breakdown on those eligible based on title can be seen below. 

*There are not enough Senior Engineers (169) to each mentor  an Engineer (501). However, there are enough Engineers to mentor Assistant Engineers (78)

*Each person with the title of Staff (155) would each get a Senior Staff mentor (569).
